# Swiggy – 10-minute Delivery  
Reimagining quick commerce sustainability under ultra-fast delivery constraints

## Overview
This case study explores how Swiggy Instamart can move toward profitability while operating in the highly competitive 10-minute delivery segment of quick commerce.

Rather than treating speed as the primary lever, the focus is on identifying where ultra-fast delivery truly creates user value and where it unnecessarily increases cost. The analysis examines user behavior, assortment relevance, fulfillment economics, and delivery expectations to rethink how quick commerce can be both useful for users and sustainable for the business.

The goal is to redesign the experience and operating model so that speed is applied selectively—only where immediacy matters—while improving conversion, trust, and unit economics.
