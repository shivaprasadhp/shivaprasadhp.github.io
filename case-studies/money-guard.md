# Money Guard  
Preventing subscription money leaks

## Overview

Money Guard is a conceptual product initiative designed to help users detect, track, and prevent unwanted subscription charges.

The case study explores how unclear billing cycles, forgotten subscriptions, and limited visibility into recurring payments lead to money leaks for users and revenue trust issues for platforms. It focuses on identifying the core problem, defining constraints, and designing a solution that balances user control with business incentives.



## Problem
Users often lose money through recurring subscriptions they no longer need or remember signing up for. These charges are typically small, spread across multiple services, and hidden behind unclear billing descriptions, making them easy to ignore individually but costly over time.

Existing banking and payment tools provide limited visibility into active subscriptions. Users lack a clear way to see, manage, or cancel recurring payments in one place, leading to frustration, distrust, and financial leakage without explicit user intent.
