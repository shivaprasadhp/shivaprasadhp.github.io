# Money Guard  
Preventing subscription money leaks

## Overview

Money Guard is a conceptual product initiative designed to help users detect, track, and prevent unwanted subscription charges.

The case study explores how unclear billing cycles, forgotten subscriptions, and limited visibility into recurring payments lead to money leaks for users and revenue trust issues for platforms. It focuses on identifying the core problem, defining constraints, and designing a solution that balances user control with business incentives.



## Problem

Users today manage multiple recurring subscriptions across entertainment, productivity, and utility services.  
Most of these subscriptions renew automatically, with charges occurring silently in the background.

While platforms do send renewal emails or billing notifications, these signals are often missed, ignored, or arrive too late to act on. As a result, users only realize they are paying for unused or forgotten subscriptions *after* the money has already been deducted.

From a user perspective, this leads to:
- Loss of money over time without clear awareness  
- Frustration and regret after discovering unnecessary charges  
- Reduced trust in subscription-based products

From a platform perspective, the issue is more nuanced:
- Auto-renewals drive predictable revenue
- Too much visibility or friction can increase churn
- Poor transparency can damage long-term trust and brand perception

The core problem is not that users dislike subscriptions —  
it’s that they lack **timely visibilit**


## Why This Matters (User & Business Impact)

### User Impact

Recurring subscription charges often go unnoticed because they happen passively and over long periods of time. Individually, these charges may seem small, but collectively they result in meaningful financial loss.

For users, this creates:
- A sense of losing control over personal finances  
- Anxiety around “hidden” or forgotten payments  
- Frustration when discovering charges too late to cancel  
- Reduced confidence in managing digital subscriptions

Over time, this erodes trust not just in individual products, but in subscription-based models as a whole.

### Business Impact

From a business standpoint, subscriptions are valuable because they provide predictable, recurring revenue. However, relying on user inattention introduces long-term risks.

Key business challenges include:
- Increased churn when users cancel multiple subscriptions at once after discovering money leaks  
- Negative brand perception when users feel tricked rather than supported  
- Higher support and refund requests driven by billing confusion  
- Lower lifetime value due to trust erosion

Solving this problem is not about encouraging cancellations —  
it’s about creating transparency and empowering users to make informed decisions.

Products that help users feel in control build stronger trust, improve retention quality, and create healthier long-term relationships with customers.
